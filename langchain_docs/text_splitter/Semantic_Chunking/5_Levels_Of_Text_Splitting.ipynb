    "# 5 Levels Of Text Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are reviewing the 5 Levels Of Text Splitting. This is an unofficial list put together for fun and educational purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ever try to put a long piece of text into ChatGPT but it tells you it’s too long? Or you're trying to give your application better long term memory, but it’s still just not quite working.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most effective strategies to improve performance of your language model applications is to split your large data into smaller pieces. This is call splitting or chunking (we'll use these terms interchangeably). In the world of multi-modal, splitting also applies to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to cover a lot, but if you make it to the end, I guarantee you’ll have a solid grasp on chunking theory, strategies, and resources to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Levels Of Text Splitting**\n",
    "* **Level 1: [Character Splitting](#CharacterSplitting)** - Simple static character chunks of data\n",
    "* **Level 2: [Recursive Character Text Splitting](#RecursiveCharacterSplitting)** - Recursive chunking based on a list of separators\n",
    "* **Level 3: [Document Specific Splitting](#DocumentSpecific)** - Various chunking methods for different document types (PDF, Python, Markdown)\n",
    "* **Level 4: [Semantic Splitting](#SemanticChunking)** - Embedding walk based chunking\n",
    "* **Level 5: [Agentic Splitting](#AgenticChunking)** - Experimental method of splitting text with an agent-like system. Good for if you believe that token cost will trend to $0.00\n",
    "* **\\*Bonus Level:\\*** **[Alternative Representation Chunking + Indexing](#BonusLevel)** - Derivative representations of your raw text that will aid in retrieval and indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook resources:**\n",
    "* [Video Overview]() - Walkthrough of this code with commentary\n",
    "* [ChunkViz.com](https://www.chunkviz.com/) - Visual representation of chunk splitting methods\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use code from LangChain (`pip install langchain`) & Llama Index (`pip install llama-index`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluations**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to test your chunking strategies in retrieval evals. It doesn't matter how you chunk if the performance of your application isn't great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eval Frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [LangChain Evals](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/evaluation/)\n",
    "* [Llama Index Evals](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/evaluating/root.html)\n",
    "* [RAGAS Evals](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm not going to demo evals for each method because success is domain specific. The arbitrary eval that I pick may not be suitable for your data. If anyone is interested in collaborating on a rigorous evaluation of different chunking strategies, please reach out (contact@dataindependent.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only walk away from this tutorial with one thing have it be the **The Chunking Commandment**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Chunking Commandment:** Your goal is not to chunk for chunking sake, our goal is to get our data in a format where it can be retrieved for value later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Level 1: Character Splitting <a id=\"CharacterSplitting\"></a>\n",
    "Character splitting is the most basic form of splitting up your text. It is the process of simply dividing your text into N-character sized chunks regardless of their content or form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method isn't recommended for any applications - but it's a great starting point for us to understand the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pros:** Easy & Simple\n",
    "* **Cons:** Very rigid and doesn't take into account the structure of your text\n",
    "\n",
    "Concepts to know:\n",
    "* **Chunk Size** - The number of characters you would like in your chunks. 50, 100, 100,000, etc.\n",
    "* **Chunk Overlap** - The amount you would like your sequential chunks to overlap. This is to try to avoid cutting a single piece of context into multiple pieces. This will create duplicate data across chunks.\n",

    "This ended up being ok, but tuning the parameters was slow and unoptimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Find break points between sequential sentences** -  \n",
    "Next up I tried a walk method. I started at the first sentence,  \n",
    "got the embedding, then compared it to sentence #2, then compared #2 and #3 and so on.  \n",

    "So I ended up taking groups of 3 sentences (a window), then got an embedding,  \n",
    "then dropped the first sentence, and added the next one. This worked out a bit better.\n",

    "Say you were to build a bot that uses slack conversations as a knowledge base. Trying to do semantic search on raw chat messages might not have the greatest results. However, if you were to generate hypothetical questions that the slack messages would answer, then when you get a new question in, you'll likely have a better chance matching.\n",

    "The code for this will be the same as the summary code, but instead of asking the LLM to make a summary, you'll ask it for hypothetical questions.\n",

    "### Parent Document Retriever (PDR)\n",
    "Much like the previous two, Parent Document Retriever builds on the concept of doing semantic search on a varied representation of your data.\n",

    "The hypothesis with the PDR is that smaller chunks have a higher likely hood of being matched semantically with a potential query. However, those smaller chunks may not have all the context they need, so instead of passing the smaller chunks to your LLM, get the parent chunk of the smaller chunk. This means you get a larger chunk which the smaller chunk is placed in.\n",
