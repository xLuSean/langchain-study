    "\n",
    "The main idea behind the Query Transformation is that translate/transform the user query in a way that the LLM can correctly answer the question. For instance, if the user asks an ambiguous question, our RAG retriever might retrieve incorrect (or ambiguous) documents based on the embeddings that are not very relevant to answer the user question, leading the LLM to hallucinate answers. There are few ways to tackle this problem. Some of them are,\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Step-back prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06117): This involves encouraging the LLM to take a step back from a given question or problem and pose a more abstract, higher-level question that encompasses the essence of the original inquiry.\n",
    "- [Least-to-most prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10625): This allows to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems.\n",
    "- Query re-writing ([Multi-Query](https://medium.com/@kbdhunga/advanced-rag-multi-query-retriever-approach-ad8cd0ea0f5b) or [RAG Fusion](https://towardsdatascience.com/forget-rag-the-future-is-rag-fusion-1147298d8ad1)): This allows to generate multiple questions from the original question with different wording and perspectives. Then retrieve documents using the similarity scores between each question and the vector store to answer the orginal question.\n",

    "In the default multi-query approach, after we retrieved the relevant documents for each question generated for our original question, we take the union of all the documents to select only unique documents (same document can be retrieved by multiple questions). However, we did not pay attention to the rank of each document in the context, which is important for the LLM to produce the most correct answer. Because the each individual rank would help us to decide the top-k documents to select as the context if we have a huge number of documents with a limited context window of the LLM. Therefore in RAG Fusion, while we do exactly the same thing upto retrieving documents, we use [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/hybrid-search-ranking) to rank the each retrieved document before using them as the context to answer our original question.
